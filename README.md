# My first IP project in the web development field
#### {This is a brief description of the projects that I've tried out so far at web development at Moringa school that include all I've learnt here at Moringa school}, {9th July 2021}
#### By **Beverly Njeri**
## Description
{Here this is a list of various links that are of the projects I've recently created and commited in the Git Hub. This includes incorporation of some styling from CSS [Cascading Style Sheets] and links of various images including an image of what represents my personality as well as an image that represents my love for art.It can be used by begginers in web development to get a better insight on what HTML language is all about.It also has quite a simple layout that's pretty easy to follow up on.It can also be used to get to understand the need of using CSS[Cascading Style Sheets]in a file to make it more presentable instead of using plain HTML language in a document which makes it look pretty dull less intriguing to read.I do hope you're able to follow up and understand as well as appreciate it too.}
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Clone this repository to your desktop
* Navigate to the top level of the directory
* Open index.html in your browser
## Known Bugs
Luckily though for anyone interested in running this IP, there are currently no known bugs hence no major work arounds required but this is especially because it's pretty new hence not much of the complex stuff in web development is incorporated here rather simple concepts are applied here in this IP.
However when clicking to some links of some images on the files,they may fail to open up directly to the source of the image.For now an alternative text has been offered right beside the link incase this happens to give more insight on what the image entails.
## Technologies Used
{HTML[Hyper Text Markup Language] is largely incorporated here in this IP as well as a bit of CSS[Cascading Style Sheets] which has helped me make the IP's layout less plain.Am not very conversant with the Bootstrap technology yet so I decided to avoid using it at this point for now.}
